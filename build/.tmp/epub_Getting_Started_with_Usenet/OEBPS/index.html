Usenet is the original way to talk have long form discussions on the internet. It’s use diminished over time as new forums such as Facebook and Twitter came around but it never became useless. Usenet’s greatest strength comes from the fact that it is completely decentralized. If every Usenet server except one were to go down, that wouldn’t be the end of Usenet. However if Facebook is down, then it’s down for everyone and when it’s gone, it will probably be gone forever.</p><p>Usenet is simple. It is based on plain text, but it’s no more difficult to use than email.</p></div></div></body></html>
