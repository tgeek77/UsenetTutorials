I'll try to impart a little bit of what I've picked up in the last two
years as a Unix troll and news reader.  Best sources for info are in
the "frequent postings" that should be found in news.announce.newusers;
I also recomend the following books:

	"Using UUCP and Usenet" ,Todino, O'Reilly & Associates
	(you may send mail to nuts@ora.com for detailed descriptions
	on this & other helpful books, etc, etc)

	"Life with Unix", Don Libes, Hayden publishers
	(publisher info not certain, but this book is
	an EXCELLENT source of info not easily found; has
	a nice "history of Usenet" section.)

These are good for starters.  Any technical bookstore should be able to
order these for you, ordinary bookstores, too, if you ask nicely.


Disclaimer:

I may not get everything right is what I'm about to say; I don't want
to lead you into gross errors, so take a look at the books, read the
"frequent postings", and pester your local experts for advice and
explanations.


Full bang paths:

News and mail originally got sent between machines via ordinary
modems and phone lines, and the set of programs that make up UUCP
facilitated the transfers.  Back then, you had to specify the path
that you wanted to send files, i.e "mail cit-vax!elroy!ames!freddy"
to send mail to user freddy on system ames.  This method of addressing
is commonly known as "bang-path" addressing ("!" is pronounced "bang").


Mailing via pathalias:

As the number of systems that ran used UUCP grew, the software
incoporated a database of paths to different systems; this is still in
use on a lot of systems, and goes by the name of pathalias.  With an
up-to-date pathalias database on my system, I no longer have to worry
about giving a full bang-path address.  Using the example above, I can
send mail to freddy at ames by entering "mail ames!freddy", and the
mail software will query the pathalias database for the routing info.


Domains and domain addressing:

The newest method for specifying addresses is known as "domain-based"
addressing.  This notation has been adopted from addressing
conventions used on the ARPAnet. (ARPAnet is no longer around, having
been replaced by a collection of interconnected networks known as the
Internet.  For our purposes, we can treat the Internet as one huge
network.)  When you see ARPAnet, JUST THINK INTERNET.  Now back to
discussion of domains.

>understanding is this -- my address is kolstad@cae.wisc.edu.

In a domain-based address, as you read from right to left, you go from
bigger to smaller domains.  Top-level domains (in U.S.A) include edu,
org, com, mil, gov, and net.  Country abbreviations are valid
top-level domains (i.e. well.sf.ca.us, system well, in SanFrancisco,
etc).  To my knowledge, UUCP is a pseudo-domain used when a system
doesn't have a valid registered domain.

For your address, wisc is a 2nd-level domain, cae is a system within
that domain (3rd level domains are possible), and kolstad is a user
(natch).  The outside world only has to worry about getting mail to the
system given in the 2nd level, which then routes it to the local
system and user.


Mailing via domain names:

Again, using the original example, I now send mail to freddy as
follows: "mail freddy@ames.nasa.gov" (names given domain-fashion don't
always exactly match with names given bang-path fashion).

>When I mail something off, say to bogus@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu, the letter
>works its way up the three until it comes to a node it recognizes --
>edu, in this case -- and then works its way back down through uiuc to
>cso, uxa, and finally to Mr. Bogus, right?

Not quite.  The topmost system in the sender's local domain does a
query of a system that acts as its "nameserver", to find out how to
access the local domain where the message is headed.  The nameserver
computers contain addressing information that allows two computers
on the Internet to make a direct, highspeed connection(~1.54Mbits/sec,
compared to 9.6Kbits/sec for the fastest modems).  This may not be the
EXACT way it's done, but you can see the contrast between this and the
UUCP-only method, where the message is passsed on by a number of
intermediate systems.

I have to point out that you don't have to have a physical connection
to the Internet to utilize domain-based addressing.  We are registered
as wciu.edu, have other machines within our local domain, and have
a listing in a nameserver with a MX (mail exchange) record that shows
what Internet-connected system handles our mail.  We connect to this
system with UUCP and a modem, and have access to the world with a
local phone call. (see map below)


            elroy.nasa.gov ==========================
	      /     [
	     /       [
	    /         [
           /           [
          /       csvax.caltech.edu
         /
    wciu.edu

csvax.caltech.edu was our prior connection to the Internet.


Mixing addressing modes:

Addresses with both domain names and bang paths in them can be
confusing, both to humans and mail forwarding software.  With real
dumb  forwarders, mixing modes will guarantee misdelivery and
frustration.  A lot of the time you will see a mixed address when
  a)  the destination isn't a registered domain,
  b)  the sender doesn't have a decent pathalias database,
  c)  or a major gateway between networks must be
      traversed (e.g., from the Internet to Bitnet).


>OK, assuming I'm right so far, let me tack on some other questions:
>What in the world do all those !'s in an address mean?  Such as

Remember that bang-paths get more specific as you read left to right,
and domain names have smaller scope as you read right to left.
I would (and hope a decent mail forwarder would) read the address
above as:
    "Deliver to system gmuvax2 within domain gmu.edu, thence to
    system ferbie, thence to user hobbes."

How the address is translated depends on whether the domain part or
the bang part is evaluated first.  I don't think the other reading is
very plausible, because you're trying to get to a domain via a system
that doesn't have a domain name.  If  the intention is "deliver to
ferbie, then gmuvax2.gmu.edu, then hobbes", the address should be
given as "ferbie!gmuvax2!hobbes", without any any domain syntax.

Here's a real-life example of mixed-mode adressing.  It hardly ever
caused bounced delivery, but I wouldn't recommend you try it.

    My address this year, since we got our domain registered, is:
	art@wciu.edu.
    Last year, because wciu.edu wasn't available, I used
	wciu!art@csvax.caltech.edu.
    Interpreted as:
    "deliver mail to domain csvax.caltech.edu, thence to system wciu,
    thence to user art."

I believe one of the "frequent postings" articles has a detailed
discussion on how and how not to go about forming addresses.

You've got Questions 2 and 3 right.  Just remember ARPAnet is dead and
buried, except for the mention of it in people's .signature files.
As for Question 1,

    "Usenet is a worldwide network of UNIX computers that run netnews
    software."
			Using UUCP and Usenet, p. 106

Usenet consists of both machines that communicate over the Internet, and
those that use strictly UUCP dial-up connections.

It depends on where you are and how your computer is set up. If you
have old/stupid software it may not go anywhere at all.

UUCP mail is designed to hop through multiple systems. UUCP uses
paths, not addresses, of the form

    neighbor1!neighbor2!neighbor3!mailbox

If you have a "smart mailer" program, it will convert Internet-style
addresses into this form. "bush@whitehouse.UUCP" would become
"whitehouse!bush". If your system did not connect with whitehouse, it
would have a delivery problem.

Fortunately, there are maps of connectivity. That is what the UUCP
Project is all about. (See comp.mail.maps.) Sites publish their
connections, and the published data can be fed to a program
(pathalias) that will produce a paths table from the perspective of
your site. A smart mailer then can employ the paths table to route
the mail properly.

Not everybody has the resources to maintain a database of all the
UUCP systems in the world. Enter the "smart host" concept. A mailer
can be configured to "kick upstairs" any undeliverable mail to
another system that presumably has more complete records.

In Europe, UUCP connectivity tends to be highly structured in
regional hub-and-spoke arrangements. It also costs money.

In North America, UUCP is uncontrolled and free (cooperative).
Connections spread like crabgrass, which can lead to some very
convoluted delivery paths. For example, we have a mail hub here in
Minnesota administered by the state Unix user group, but mail also
may go directly to the destination system or hop through several
other systems. Most areas have no hubs at all.
