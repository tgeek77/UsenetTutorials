Many newsgroups contain articles which are posted on a periodic basis.
These articles tend to be useful for both novice and experienced
users, as they usually fall into one of these categories:

    1. How-to articles explaining some of the basics and fine
    points of network usage, etiquette, standards, etc.

    2. Introductory notes about one or more newsgroups, covering
    policies (if any) for submissions to that group, usage, etc.
    Common questions and answers pertinent to a newsgroup(s).

    3. Indexes of archives, or pointers to archives for various
    groups.  Periodic newsletters, calendars, pointers to
    publications.

    4. Statistical information and reports about Usenet; tables of
    Usenet hosts, links, etc.

    5. Miscellany, including small useful sources, "fun" lists, and so
    on.

This is a list of the periodic postings known at this time; each
posting is listed in an entry that includes who posts the article,
which newsgroup(s) it appears in, what "Subject" line is used, and how
often the article is posted.  The list is sorted by the "Newsgroups"
line.  The character '*' is used as a wildcard, e.g. "v**INF1" matches
"v01INF1", "v02INF1", etc.

Corrections and additions (via MAIL) are most welcome.

Jonathan Kamens of MIT's Project Athena has kindly set up an archive
of periodic postings; the archive is constructed by a shell script
which reads this article, using it as a guide as to which postings
should be archived.  What follows is a condensed excerpt of his article
announcing this archive...

This archive is on "pit-manager.mit.edu" (18.72.1.58), and is accessible
via anonymous ftp in the directory "/pub/usenet".  The structure of
this directory is such that each subdirectory is a newsgroup name, and
the files in the subdirectories are the periodic postings.  The filenames
are constructed by mapping the titles to filenames in a pretty simple way, e.g.

    /pub/usenet/news.announce.newusers/Answers_to_Frequently_Asked_Questions

The archive is also accessible via mail archive server.  The address of the
server is mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu.  The names are the same, with the
"/pub/" chopped off.  To retrieve the file mentioned above, you would send
mail to the mail-server with a subject or body of

    send usenet/news.announce.newusers/Answers_to_Frequently_Asked_Questions

You can also do "send help", "send index", "send usenet/index", "send
usenet/news.announce.newusers/index", etc.

  Comments, questions, suggestions, etc. can be sent to me at the address
below, or at {root,jik,postmaster,daemon}@pit-manager.mit.edu.  Feel free to
mention this service in any informational postings you may maintain; I hope to
keep it up and running for a while.
