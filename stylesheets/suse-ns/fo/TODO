NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATION
- Nested lists are sometimes not indented
- Index entries: second entries should be visually distinct from first
  level entries
- Index contains empty "Symbols" entry. How can we discard that?
- Index problems: Sort order is not correct according to Patrick vom VistaTec.
  Affected languages are Spanish and French
- article/title is sometimes centered sometimes not



NEEDS CORRECTIONS:
- Footer doesn't appear in index
- Preface sections shouldn't have a number
- Verso footer doesn't contain title. At the moment phrase inside title
  seems not to work.


NICE TO HAVE:
- keycaps: Probably a SVG picture to have a nice little keycap
- Spacing problem after substep and before step: A little bit too
  much space
- Unsorted glossary is sorted automatically
- Should we keep admonition boxes together?


FUTURE:
- Keep in mind the current target os and arch attributes and compare
  them to some e.g. para elements. Only insert a "visual marker", if
  there are additional profiling attribute in an element.
- indexterms in lists creates one linebreak too much
  Fixed 2005-10-13
  Note: It is _not_ in the FO or HTML stylesheets. So this works only,
        if you do your profiling step. We should consider to add it
        to the FO and HTML stylesheet customization


DONE:
- Fixed numbering of appendices in parts
  -> Fixed 2005-02-06
- Corrected distance between starts and label separation in procedure
  lists (with count(step)>9 )
  -> Fixed 2006-02-01
- Page counter is different between print and online manual (maybe the same
  error that encountered Jana with AppArmor?)
  -> Possible Bug in the original DocBook Stylesheets
     Asked on the docbook-apps mailinglist 2005-09-22
  -> Bug #1306070 fixed on 2005-09-27 23:38 by bobstayton
- If no part is specified, page numbers on the next chapter start not with 1
  -> Probably related to the previous bug
- article titlepage contains footer (Fixed 2005-09-27)
- set without @role doesn't work for xrefs (Fixed 2005-09-20)
- caption title for procedure, table, example and figure needs to be
  "localization aware". It means that the width of the label should
  be taken into account so that no linebreaks occurs.
  (Fixed 2005-09-23 with fo:float object)

- Text is left ragged now
- glossary/title, preface/title: Not centered
- toc: Needs improvement of keeping things together
- toc: Long titles doesn't wrap into next line and spread page number
- Chapter number on the right margin is printed now
- Footer doesn't appear in appendix, index (probably also in glossary, ...)
- variablelist: indendation, terms in bold etc.
- admonition boxes should contain localized admonition text (tip, warning, ...)
  _and_ title (if there)
- section titles: Insert label and title as a list or table to
  have better indendation of title
- table: lines and spaces between top and bottom row
- remark in lists creates an empty line
  (AI: wrote to docbook-apps mailinglist on 21. July 2005)
  Answer: It is very difficult to know, where to insert a space after or before
  and where not.
- Admonitions titles: Artifical titles like Tip, Warning, etc.
  occured twice, if no title element is given
- Support of PI for screen to adjust font size (especially for
  long lines)
- screen: omit carriage returns after <screen> and before </screen>
